        To build this project, I first researched modern UI and UX principles to
        ensure a clean, intuitive design. I sketched wireframes and created mockups
        using Figma, drawing inspiration from minimalist interfaces like Appleâ€™s,
        while adding my own unique touches. I selected images and visual elements
        carefully to complement the layout without overwhelming it. I then
        implemented the design using React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring responsive
        layouts across different devices. Finally, I reviewed my work to make sure
        the portfolio clearly showcased my projects, technical skills, and
        attention to user experience.
