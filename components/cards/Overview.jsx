        I wanted to create a project that highlights my skills while keeping the
        design clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. My goal was to ensure that
        anyone, whether they're a recruiter, fellow developer, or casual visitor,
        can quickly understand my work without feeling overwhelmed.
