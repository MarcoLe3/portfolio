        I needed to research UI and UX principles to create a clean, simple, and
        user-friendly design. It was important to identify which skills and experiences to showcase and how, including key projects,
        practical work, and design abilities, to present a well-rounded and engaging
        portfolio that highlights both my technical expertise and attention to user
        experience.
